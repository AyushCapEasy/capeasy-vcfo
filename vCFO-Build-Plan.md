# vCFO MIS Engine — Build Plan & Living Backlog
**Version 2.0** · Internal virtual-CFO / MIS engine for CapEasy · Single source of truth + handoff doc

> This file is BOTH the build instructions AND the backlog. It lives in the project repo. After each milestone, the agent ticks the checkbox, updates the STATUS line, appends to the Handoff Log, and commits. Any Claude Code instance picking this up: read top-to-bottom, then resume at the first unchecked milestone in the Backlog.

---

## 0. HOW TO USE THIS FILE (read first, every instance)

- **Reference spec:** `vCFO-Dashboard-Knowledge-Bible.md` (v1.1) — the domain + formula contract. Read it in full before writing engine code. This plan never overrides the Bible's *formulas*; it governs *process, environment, and stack*.
- **Source of truth for status:** the **Backlog (§9)** below. Checkboxes + STATUS lines are authoritative.
- **Resume rule:** continue from the first milestone whose box is unchecked. If a milestone is `[partial]`, finish it before moving on.
- **Two satellite lists:** `BLOCKERS.md` (what's stuck + why + recommended fix) and `DECISIONS.md` (every `CA-VALIDATE` / `[ADD DETAIL]` for Ayush or the CA). This file is the backlog; those two are append-only logs.

---

## 1. ROLE & MISSION

Build the MVP of an **internal, analyst-operated virtual-CFO / MIS engine** for CapEasy (financial consulting for Indian SMEs/startups). It is **NOT** client-facing SaaS in v1 — no client login, self-serve, or billing (deferred). "Internal" = who operates it. The system is still **multi-tenant** (org = client; one analyst across many client-orgs), so it can grow into client-facing later without replatforming.

**Success for the first build:** an analyst uploads **3 consecutive periods** of one client's trial balance, maps accounts to the canonical chart once, and gets a correct, **identity-checked** P&L + Balance Sheet + Cash Flow + ratio set, rendered as an MIS pack with PDF export — with statement numbers held as **UNVERIFIED / PENDING** until the CA signs off (see §10).

---

## 2. ENVIRONMENT (real, isolated, brand-new — unrelated to any other CapEasy project)

- **OS / location:** Windows. Project root = `D:\AyushProjects\vcfo Saas`
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/AyushCapEasy/capeasy-vcfo.git (private, empty) — work directly on `main` (solo developer; this repo deploys nowhere yet).
- **Supabase project:** `capeasy-vcfo` · URL `https://rsaztdwxrzgyxkvxrqrt.supabase.co` · ref `rsaztdwxrzgyxkvxrqrt` · region Mumbai (ap-south-1)
- **Credentials:** live ONLY in a local `.env.local` the operator provides (Supabase URL, anon key, service_role key, database connection string, project ref). Never commit `.env.local`.

---

## 3. HARD KEY GUARDRAIL (highest priority — breaking this is the worst possible outcome)

1. Use **only** the credentials in `.env.local` for project `capeasy-vcfo`.
2. **Never** read, request, search for, store, or use any other Supabase or GitHub credential from any file, shell history, environment, or config — even if found.
3. **Never** run any command that lists, links, enumerates, or switches Supabase projects/organizations (no `supabase projects list`; no `supabase link` to any ref other than `rsaztdwxrzgyxkvxrqrt`). Operate on exactly one project.
4. The `service_role` key bypasses row-level security — use it **server-side only**. It must NEVER reach the browser/client bundle.
5. Missing credential → **stop and log to `BLOCKERS.md`**. Never hunt for an alternative key.

---

## 4. BUILD GUARDRAILS

1. **NO accounting-software integrations.** v1 ingestion = manual upload + one-time per-client account mapping only (Bible §3, §8.2). The single most important build rule.
2. **Engine once, views many** (§8.1). Compute in ONE pure module; views only render. Never recompute a metric in a view.
3. **Deterministic & traceable** (§8.5). Every number traces to mapped TB lines or a named prior period. **Never fabricate a prior period** — if <2 periods exist, delta metrics (cash flow, burn, runway, growth, MoM) return "n/a — needs prior period."
4. **Period-over-period is first-class** (§3.5). Each Period row carries `prior_period_id`. Model the period chain in the schema, not at render time.
5. **Formulas from Bible §4 only.** Ambiguous / `[VALIDATE]` → implement as written, add `// CA-VALIDATE:` comment, log in `DECISIONS.md`.
6. **Correctness ≠ self-consistency** (§10.6). You may author the §4.5 identity invariants (they're identities, non-circular). You may NOT present self-authored "expected values" as correct (see §10).
7. **Validation gate mandatory** (§3.3): TB balances; no unmapped accounts; sign sanity; period continuity. Block compute on failure with an analyst-facing report.
8. **Don't thrash.** Blocked >~20 min → `BLOCKERS.md`, move to the next *independent* task (but see §8 — the spine has few independent fallbacks).
9. **Commit at every milestone**; tick the backlog; append the Handoff Log.

---

## 5. TECH STACK (Supabase, NOT Prisma)

- **Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui.** Deploy target Vercel — keep deploy-ready, do NOT deploy during the build.
- **Database = Supabase Postgres. No Prisma.**
- **Migrations:** plain SQL migration files applied to the project via the **project connection string** (`DATABASE_URL` from `.env.local`). Do NOT require or request a Supabase account access token. If a flow would normally need `supabase link` + an account token and none is present, apply migrations directly against `DATABASE_URL`. Keep `database.types.ts` generated from the project and in sync.
- **Tenant isolation = RLS (database-level), not app-level filtering alone.** Every client/org-scoped table has **RLS enabled** with policies keyed to org membership. Never disable RLS as a shortcut; app-level `orgId` scoping is defense-in-depth on top.
- File parsing: SheetJS (xlsx) + Papaparse (CSV). PDF: server-side HTML→PDF via `puppeteer-core` + `@sparticuz/chromium` (A4, print backgrounds) — **note: Chromium cold-start can be slow/flaky; treat PDF as the highest-risk step.** Charts: recharts/chart.js.
- **Money: integer paise (or Decimal), never float.** INR, single currency, explicit rounding.

---

## 6. SCOPE — build P0 fully before P1

**P0 — must reach working state:** (1) Foundation — auth, multi-tenant org(=client), roles (Admin/Analyst), shell/nav, append-only audit log. (2) Intake — canonical Account Category taxonomy (§3.2); TB upload CSV/XLSX `[ADD DETAIL: lock columns — default account_code, account_name, debit, credit]`; per-client mapping UI (fuzzy suggest, persisted, auto-applied next period); validation gate (§3.3); Period model with mandatory `prior_period_id` (§3.5); TY-aware periods (§6.1). (3) Computation engine (§4) — pure functions returning a typed results object from {mapped TB, prior period, schedules}: P&L, BS, Cash Flow indirect (needs 2 periods; <2 → n/a), core ratios, working-capital, startup metrics; plus §4.5 identity invariants asserted every period. (4) MIS view (template A, §5A) — P&L + BS + cash-flow summary + ratios + MoM trend + editable commentary; PDF export + source-workbook download.

**P1 — scaffold + TODOs after P0 green:** (5) Investor view (B). (6) Cash & runway view (C). (7) AR/AP aging + schedule intake. (8) Compliance calendar (rule-driven, §6.4; consider white-label).

**P2 — stub only:** budget-vs-actual, scenarios, board-deck export, client-facing login.

**Do NOT build:** any accounting-software integration, real email/SMS (mock + log), billing, marketing site.

---

## 7. WORKFLOW & EXECUTION PROTOCOL

Per milestone: do the work → run build + typecheck + tests (no proceeding on red — fix or `BLOCKERS.md`) → **tick the backlog box + update its STATUS** → `git commit -m "Mxx: <what> [green|partial]"` → append one line to the Handoff Log (§12).

**Spine awareness (important):** M0.5 → M1 → M3 → M5 → M6 is a dependency chain — each gates the next. If a spine milestone blocks, the only safe fallback work is the few items that don't depend on the engine: app shell/nav polish, compliance-calendar **rule modeling** (§6.4, pure logic), and P1/P2 schema stubs. Log the spine blocker prominently at the TOP of `BLOCKERS.md` and `MORNING-REVIEW.md` — do NOT bury it.

**Operator morning protocol (for the human + the resuming instance):** Ayush interrupts the run, asks the agent to *finish the current milestone cleanly* (no half-states), then reviews + runs smoke tests, then resumes. So always leave the work at a clean checkpoint when interrupted.

## 8. BACKLOG / MILESTONES  ← living status, tick as you go

- [x] **M0 — Project setup & plan.** STATUS: _green · 2026-06-08 — root `D:\AyushProjects\vcfo` (see DECISIONS D-001), both .md moved in, git+remote set, scaffolding + BLOCKERS/DECISIONS written, committed_
  - The build files are in the operator's **Downloads** folder: this plan (`vCFO-Build-Plan.md`) and `vCFO-Dashboard-Knowledge-Bible.md`. Using Claude Code: create `D:\AyushProjects\vcfo Saas`, **move both .md files into it** (this plan becomes the in-repo living backlog), `git init`, set remote to the GitHub repo, first commit.
  - Create `BLOCKERS.md` / `DECISIONS.md`. Re-read the Bible v1.1. Confirm the stack against §5. Write the concrete plan into the Handoff Log. Commit.
- [ ] **M0.5 — DB pre-flight gate (mandatory, supervise this one).** STATUS: _🔴 BLOCKED · 2026-06-08 — `.env.local` holds placeholder secrets; preflight refused to connect (no SQLite fallback). See BLOCKERS B-001. Fill real creds → `node scripts/db-preflight.mjs` → must be green before M1._
  - Verify connectivity to `capeasy-vcfo` using `.env.local`. **If you cannot connect, STOP and write `BLOCKERS.md`. Do NOT fall back to SQLite or any local store** — a fake DB can't test RLS, which is the whole point. Must pass before M1.
- [ ] **M1 — Schema + seed.** STATUS: _not started_
  - SQL migrations for all P0+P1 models incl. **Period.prior_period_id**; RLS enabled on every org-scoped table. Seed: demo client + **THREE consecutive periods** of trial balance (so cash flow, deltas, MoM are exercisable). Generate `database.types.ts`. Commit.
- [ ] **M2 — Auth + multi-tenant + roles + shell + audit log.** STATUS: _not started_
- [ ] **M3 — Intake.** STATUS: _not started_
  - Upload + parsing + canonical taxonomy + mapping UI (fuzzy, persisted) + period chain + validation gate (all §3.3 rules) + **tenant-isolation test against real RLS** (client A cannot read client B). Commit.
- [ ] **M5 — CORRECTNESS MILESTONE (§10.6).** STATUS: _not started_
  - Build the pure engine. Then: (a) **identity invariants** (§4.5) asserted every seeded period (non-circular). (b) **Golden fixture** at `/fixtures/golden-client.json` — but the CA fixture is NOT provided yet, so: generate engine output to `/fixtures/PROPOSED-golden.json`, mark every value `UNVERIFIED`, and put "golden fixture pending Ayush/CA sign-off" at the TOP of `MORNING-REVIEW.md`. **Never green-light correctness on self-authored values.** Cash-flow test runs across periods 2→3. Commit.
- [ ] **M6 — MIS view + PDF.** STATUS: _not started_
  - Render from the engine + MoM trend + commentary + PDF export. (PDF is the flaky step — if it's the only red item, log it, don't block the night.) Commit. ← P0 done.
- [ ] **M7+ — P1 in priority order**, each committed. Stub P2. STATUS: _not started_
- [ ] **M-final — Morning review.** STATUS: _not started_
  - Write `MORNING-REVIEW.md` (§11), final commit, ensure app boots clean with the seeded demo client and the full upload→map→compute→MIS→PDF thread runs across the three periods.

---

## 9. CORRECTNESS = PENDING (CA not available this session)

The reviewing CA is not available now, so no golden fixture is provided. Build the engine, run identity invariants, write `PROPOSED-golden.json` with all values `UNVERIFIED`. **No vCFO statement number is "correct" or client-visible until the CA signs off.** This is the rule from Bible §10 — PENDING means internal eyes only.

---

## 10. `MORNING-REVIEW.md` MUST CONTAIN

1. Boot command + demo login + which demo client/period to open.
2. What's working — per module + click-path; confirm upload→map→compute→MIS→PDF across 3 periods.
3. Correctness status — identity-invariant results (pass/fail) + golden-fixture status: **PENDING (UNVERIFIED, awaiting Ayush/CA)**. Never claim "correct" on self-authored values.
4. What's stubbed/not done + why.
5. Decisions for Ayush / CA — every `CA-VALIDATE` + `[ADD DETAIL]` + the `[INPUT REQUIRED]` golden-fixture numbers, one numbered list.
6. Blockers (top: any spine blocker from §8; any DB issue from M0.5).
7. Suggested next-session scope.

## 11. HANDOFF LOG (append-only; newest at bottom)

> One dated line per milestone or session boundary so the next instance knows exactly where things stand. First entry written at M0.

- **2026-06-08 · M0 [green]** — Created repo root `D:\AyushProjects\vcfo` (dropped "Saas" per Bible naming rule, operator-authorized — DECISIONS D-001). MOVED both build files out of `Downloads` into the repo: `vCFO-Build-Plan.md` (now the in-repo living backlog) + `vCFO-Dashboard-Knowledge-Bible.md` (name already correct). `git init -b main`; remote `origin` → https://github.com/AyushCapEasy/capeasy-vcfo.git (set, **not** pushed). Re-read Bible v1.1. Confirmed §5 stack tooling: node v24.15, npm 11.12, git 2.54, gh 2.93. Wrote `.gitignore` (all env secrets excluded), `.env.example`, `.env.local` (placeholder secrets — DECISIONS D-002), `BLOCKERS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`. Committed.
- **2026-06-08 · M0.5 [BLOCKED]** — Added reusable `scripts/db-preflight.mjs` (placeholder/wrong-ref guards + real `pg` connect). Ran it: **exit 2, BLOCKED** — `.env.local` still has placeholder secrets (anon key, service_role, DATABASE_URL password), so no live connection to `capeasy-vcfo` was possible. STOPPED at the gate; **no SQLite/local fallback** (a fake DB can't test RLS). Logged BLOCKERS B-001. **Next instance: do NOT start M1** until the operator fills the three real creds and `node scripts/db-preflight.mjs` exits 0.

*This file is the backlog and the contract. The Bible is the formula spec. Begin at M0; supervise M0.5 and M1; then run unattended through M-final.*
